#  Pizza 42 - An Auth0 Demo
Pizza 42 is a (fictitious) national pizza delivery chain. Theyâ€™re in the process of modernizing their online ordering system and would like to use Auth0 for their identity needs.
This demo showcases multiple features of Auth0 using its [React SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-react), primarily:
- Login with Google as Social Provider
- Protect routes using Access Token scopes
- Enrich user profile information with user_metadata

## Live Demo
You can access a live demo [here](https://pizza42-auth0.herokuapp.com/)

## Configuration
Make sure to replace the values on auth_config.json file; take a look at the [original repo](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-react-samples) for more information

You will also need to create a .env file with the variables: CLIENT_ID, BACKEND_CLIENT_ID, BACKEND_CLIENT_SECRET

## Run the sample

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

Compiles and minifies for production. It will also start up a server on port 3000

```bash
npm run prod
```
